## About Me
Hi, My name  Xuwang Yin, a PhD candidate in Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Virginia. I work in the [Imaging and Data Science Lab](http://imagedatascience.com/), coordinated by Professor Gustavo K. Rohde. I have done some work in adversarial machine learning, generative modeling, and cell image classification.

## Projects


- **PyTransKit** [[github link](https://github.com/rohdelab/PyTransKit)]

  Python Library for Signal/Image Data Analysis with Transport Methods
  
- **Cell Image Classification Toolbox** [[github link](https://github.com/rohdelab/cell-image-classification)]

  A toolbox for training cell images classification models. Supported models include neural networks (MLP, customized CNN, VGG, InceptionV3, ResNet, etc.), and statistical ML models (SVM, logitic regression, random forest, etc.). Support training with cross-validation, data augmentation and fine-tuning.
