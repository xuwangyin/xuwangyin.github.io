            <h2>One model should be enough.</h2>
            <p>Generative AI and discriminative AI have traditionally been two separate worlds—different models, different training, different applications. A classifier classifies. A generator generates. But understanding and creation are two sides of the same coin. I'm working on models that do both—robustly classify and generate high-quality images—trained with a single objective.</p>

            <h2>Simplicity scales.</h2>
            <p>Energy-based models have elegant theory but notoriously unstable training. By rethinking adversarial training as a generative objective, I achieved the first stable EBM training at ImageNet 256×256 scale—matching autoregressive models, surpassing diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Safety is not an afterthought.</h2>
            <p>Previously at the <a href="https://www.safe.ai/">Center for AI Safety</a>, I worked on evaluating and red-teaming language models, understanding how they fail before they're deployed.</p>
