            <h2>One model should be enough.</h2>
            <p>Generative AI and discriminative AI have traditionally been two separate worlds—different models, different training, different applications. But a model that truly understands should be able to both recognize and imagine. Inspired by <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-06.pdf">Yann LeCun's energy-based models</a>, I'm building models that do both—robustly classify and generate high-quality images—trained with a single objective, using adversarial training to shape the energy landscape.</p>

            <p>Previously at the <a href="https://www.safe.ai/">Center for AI Safety</a>, I worked on evaluating and red-teaming language models, understanding how they fail before they're deployed.</p>
